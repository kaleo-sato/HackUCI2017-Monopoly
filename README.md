# HackUCI2017-Monopoly
Collaborative hackathon project with Mithil Hari (https://github.com/mithilhari), Chinmay Raut (https://github.com/cvraut), and Lawrence Lim (https://github.com/lawrencekhlim)

This was our project for University of California at Irvine's hackathon in January 2017. The hackathon lasted about 36 hours and this project won the award for Best Data Science Project of the competition.

The project simulated a game of Monopoly and analyzed the best properties through calculation of what properties are landed on the most. It displayed results on graph containing return on investment and best early game and late game strategies. In order to generate the data, we had to build Monopoly from the ground up, and then rolled the dice a bunch of times in order to find out the probabilities of landing on spaces as well as the profit each space will yield and how long it takes to pay out. We put the data into graphs, which can be found in this repository.

Our findings and conclusions from our generated data is shown in this github repository's hompage:
